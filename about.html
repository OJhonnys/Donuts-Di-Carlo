                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <h2>Family-owned since 1989</h2>
                <p>Crafted with tradition, love, and a little bit of sugar.</p>
                <p>
                <strong>Donuts di Carlo</strong> was born from a dream, a deep love
                for family traditions, and the irresistible aroma of freshly made donuts.
                </p>
                <p>
                Our story begins with <strong>Mr. Di Carlo</strong>, a passionate young man who immigrated from Italy to North America as a child, along with his parents. Growing up, the kitchen was always the heart of the home—a place filled with laughter, stories, and the cherished recipes passed down through generations. <strong>From a very young age, Mr. Di Carlo was fascinated by the art of baking and the warmth it brought to every family gathering.</strong>

                    <strong>In 1989, newly married and full of determination, he opened a small donut shop on Anywhere Street in Any City.</strong>
                    With just a few classic recipes, a strong work ethic, and a dream to bring a taste of his heritage to the community, <strong>Donuts di Carlo was born</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What started as a humble family bakery soon became a local favorite, known for its <strong>handcrafted donuts made with fresh ingredients and old-world care</strong>. 
                    Over the years, our passion has remained the same: creating donuts that bring joy, comfort, and a touch of nostalgia to everyone who takes a bite.
